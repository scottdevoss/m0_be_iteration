# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?

'Each' is useful because it allows you to select specific or all elements within an array. I can see this being helpful when there are many elements and its a fast way to write our multiple lines of code from an array. 

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?

I think I need to practice using the correct technical vocabulary. It will be helpful to run through these assignments again and refer to my notes when needed. Commit it to muscle memory. 

- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?

I understand how everything is working so far and feel good about that. Writing down and reviewing the notes have been helpful before starting assignments. The technical vocab is making me slow down a bit to make sure I can talk through what I am doing.
